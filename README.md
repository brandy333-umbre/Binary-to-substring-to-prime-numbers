# Binary-to-substring-to-prime-numbers
This program take a binary input and a limit and creates a set of all the possible binary substrings from that original binary input, it then converts all the substring to denery numbers, then checks if these numbers are primes, if there are more than 6 primes, them the program will output the three smallest and the three largest primes.
